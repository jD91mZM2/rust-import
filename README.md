# rust-import

First attempt at making an importing utility in Rust.

## Why?

The goal is to get some sort of auto-importing to Rust.  
Having a reliable way to add an import statement would greatly help with this.

## Goals

 - [ ] Actually make it work (See [dtolnay/syn#294](https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/issues/294))
 - [ ] Add missing `extern crate`s
 - [ ] Automatically add imports
 - [ ] Group imports
 - [ ] Sort imports

## How do I use it?

**Abslutely not**. This is not in a usable state yet.
